# Autonomous-Things-Project_Sharella

Designed and implemented a prototype of Autonomous System “Sharella (Sharing Economy+Umbrella)” 
based on Firebase to integrate with customized app and Raspberry Pi which controls the hardware. 
Literally, it serves as a platform to share umbrellas from anywhere to anyone.
